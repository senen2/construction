# I made this project to calculate the cost of my house.

First I began with an spreadsheet but this is good how a starting point but when you advance is very limited an confuse
I ever thinked in how easy was to do the backend in python but I get bored when though in the UI, I hate build UIs. Then I realized that it is possible to do this in python for me I don't need UI, pandas print capabilities are suffice to me.

Then I did it. After I was looking for an application for 3D modeling of the house, and found blender. Blender is python also, then I build a little interface with my programa and voila with a pair of clicks I got the cost of my house.

After that success I thougth I can get the bill of materials also, then I build it.

Now, I want to give you this work as a little contribution to this world of Python and Blender and other open source projects that have given me so much. 

I would appreciate if you can give some ideas or made changes or contributions.

# How it works

Give a look at the file casa.py

# In blender

Give a look at the file blender.py

I build my project with cubes. Wall, beam, column, floor, ceiling, all area cubes. In this script I recognize the type of element by its material
